# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).  
The goal of this challenge was to build a simple and responsive QR code card using only HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

This project helped me practice the basics of:
- Centering elements using **Flexbox** (`justify-content` and `align-items`)  
- Using `max-width` to make designs responsive  
- Adding external fonts from **Google Fonts**  
- Structuring a clean and simple card layout  

Example of a snippet I used for centering the card:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
